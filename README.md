# Purposely Vulnerable Server Setup Scripts

Scripts and configurations for setting up intentionally vulnerable servers for penetration testing and learning.

## Purpose üéØ

This repository contains scripts and configurations to quickly deploy various intentionally vulnerable servers. These setups are designed for:
- Penetration testing practice
- Security research
- Educational purposes
- Testing security tools and methodologies

## Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
**WARNING**: These scripts are designed to create intentionally vulnerable systems. They should ONLY be used in:
- Isolated testing environments
- Controlled lab environments
- Educational settings
- With explicit permission

Never deploy these configurations in production or public-facing environments (and if you do I take no accountability).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of server administration
- A safe, isolated environment for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cwsecur1ty/VSSS-Pen-testing-
cd VSSS-Pen-testing-
```

2. Review the setup scripts and configurations before running them.

3. Follow the specific instructions in each server's directory for deployment.

## Available Server Configurations

- To be added later

## üîí Security Considerations

- Always run these servers in isolated environments
- Never expose these servers to the internet
- Use strong network segmentation
- Monitor all testing activities
- Document all testing procedures
